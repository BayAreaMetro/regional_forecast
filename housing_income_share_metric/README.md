# Share of HH Income Spent on Housing Metric

Most of the files in this folder have been deprecated as the code to estimate the share of household income spent on housing has been moved here: [bayarea_urbansim/scripts/metrics/metrics_affordable.py:`housing_cost_share_of_income()`](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/bayarea_urbansim/blob/main/scripts/metrics/metrics_affordable.py)

The only files remaining in use by that script have been moved to Box.

For the PBA50+ Draft Blueprint, they can be found here:
* [scenario_specific_parameters.csv](https://mtcdrive.box.com/s/ll9ed0rkxcl32fwu6227qpssd03epad5)
* [ACS_PUMS_2019_Share_Income_Spent_on_Housing_by_Quartile.csv](https://mtcdrive.box.com/s/9f10v79fg5x9b0ft2gik8ec85u5ezc9u)
