S24 is the final blueprint scenario. Compared to S23, the only is in the income distribution of the households. This change is resulted from 
the implementation of the UBI strategy in the final blueprint, which was not included in S23. 

Using PUMS 2014-2018 data, 691463 households have household income under $30000 (1999 dollars) -- these are the q1 households. The UBI strategy 
distribute $6000 (2019 dollars, which is $3625 in 1999 dollars) to q1 households. Since 11.6% of the q1 households have an income that is no more
than $3625 dollars under the threshold of $30,000. We move 11.6% q1 households into q2 to simulate the impacts of the UBI for all future years. 

Since the plan starts at 2021. We only changes numbers for 2025-2050, and keep 2010, 2015, 2020 the same.
